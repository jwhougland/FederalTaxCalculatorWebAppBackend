Spring Boot application that provides REST APIs to support accepting user inputs for estimating high level federal tax metrics, and returns data to a REACT APP (https://github.com/jwhougland/FederalIncomeTaxCalculatorWebAppUI) so it can display in a tabular format federal taxes owed, marginal tax rate, effective tax rate, and take home pay.

Locally it can be accessed via: http://localhost:3000 when the companion REACT app is run locally.

The app can also be accessed via Netlify (note the backend service must be started up manually due to free edition limitations):
