Spring Boot application that provides REST APIs to support accepting user inputs for estimating high level federal tax metrics, and returns data to a REACT APP (https://github.com/jwhougland/FederalIncomeTaxCalculatorWebAppUI) so it can display in a tabular format federal taxes owed, marginal tax rate, effective tax rate, and take home pay.

Locally it can be accessed via: http://localhost:3000 when the companion REACT app is run locally.
